# Facebook-add-friend-UI
The Facebook Add Friend UI Clone is a front-end project that replicates the user interface of Facebookâ€™s friend request feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a clean card-style design displaying a user's profile picture, name, and two buttons: "Add Friend" and "Remove".
